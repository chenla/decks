This repo holds all of the presentations that have been created for
Chenla that use [[https://github.com/yjwen/org-reveal%0A][org-reveal]] and [[https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/][reveal.js]].

All presentations are released under an MIT licence.  We have tried to
be careful about using images that use a licence that allows reuse,
but please let us know if we have used an image improperly. 

We will provide links here when we get presentations properly hosted
on Chenla's new website (it's coming, really).
