* Introduction

#+BEGIN_NOTES
 - Multi-Disciplinary (as MediaLab called themselves--antidisiplinary)
 - Conduct research to address critical needs, with a view to how the
   results can be used to directly improve the lives of people in the
   biogregions of the Lower Mekokong Subregion.
 - b>i is a long term project that is part of Chenla to help build a
   distributed antifragile civilization.
 - Our first campus is located at Prek Leap National College of
   Agriculture outside of Phnom Penh, and we have plans to build a
   sister research group in Champasak, Laos which is also on the banks
   of the Mekong River.
