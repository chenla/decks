* b>i research group I

#+begin_quote
The /b>i research group/ is a multi-disciplinary research group that
combines agriculture, biology, chemistry, engineering, architecture,
and information science that will help mankind make the transition
from a single global centralized civilization to a decentralized and
distributed civilization that can meet the challenges that will face
our species and out planet over the comming decades.
#+end_quote

#+begin_notes
 - Multi-Disciplinary (as MediaLab called themselves--antidisiplinary)
 - Conduct research to address critical needs.
 - b>i is a long term project that is part of Chenla to help build a
   distributed antifragile civilization.
 - Our first campus is located at Prek Leap National College of
   Agriculture outside of Phnom Penh, and we have plans to build a
   sister research group in Champasak, Laos which is also on the banks
   of the Mekong River.

* b>i research group II

For this to happen, technology and solutions must /scale/. So all
research and technology developed by b>i must:

  - Work at very small /and/ very large scales.  We have forgotten how
    to do many industrial processes at small scales, let alone at
    cost-effective small scales.
  - Whenever possible be modular, built on open designs, and work in a
    wide range of physical, social and economic contexts.
  - Contribute to improve the lives of people living in the bioregions
    of the Lower Mekong River Subregion.

#+begin_notes
 - To achieve these goals solutions must scale, with a view to how the
   results can be used to directly improve the lives of people in the
   biogregions of the Lower Mekokong Subregion.
 - b>i is a long term project that is part of Chenla to help build a
   distributed antifragile civilization.

* It From Bit

#+CAPTION: John Archibald Wheeler (1911-2008)
[[./img/intro/john-wheeler.jpg]]

#+begin_notes
- Our name b>i (pronounced bee-eye) comes from a paper called "Recent
  Thinking about the Nature of the Physical World: It from Bit“ by the
  Physicist John Wheeler.
- Wheeler is known for his work on fission in the Manhatten Project, 
  the Hydrogen Bomb and quantum physics.
- Wheeler's role was to inspire by asking deep questions from a
  radical conservative viewpoint and, through his questions, to
  stimulate others’ research and discovery

- NOTE for Munzer and UOT :: Though he spent most of
     career at Princeton, he was the director of the Center for
     Theoretical Physics at the University of Texas at Austin from
     1976 until 1986, and the University of Texas named a lecture hall
     after him, after his death.

* It From Bit (cont)

#+begin_quote
The thesis /it from bit/: every /it/, every particle, every field of
force, even the spacetime continuum itself, derives... from... answers
to yes and no questions, binary choices, /bits/..... all things
physical... must in the end submit to an information-theoretic
description.

-- John Archibald Wheeler (1911-2008)
#+end_quote


#+begin_notes
- In essense, Wheeler argued, the universe can be thought of as source
  code, /information/ or /bits/ that has been compiled into the
  physical world of space, time, matter and energy, /its/ that we see
  around us....
- The b>i research group uses this premise that all disciplines, be it
  agriculture, chemistry, engineering, medicine and biology can all
  benifit from understanding them as information systems.
- Our logo plays on the idea of /it from bit/ as a unix command, where
  /bits/ are compiled and saved />/ into /its/
